Avoid low resolution (below 480x736) and poorly composed shots with awkward framing or unbalanced composition. Reject amateurish, deformed, or overly stylized renderings that detract from feline realism. Do not generate images with harsh shadows, overexposure, or unnatural color casts that disrupt serenity. Prioritize a soft focus effect with shallow depth of field on the cat's face, gentle warm lighting, and subtle highlights on whiskers.\"",
