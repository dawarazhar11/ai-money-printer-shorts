# Typography Effects for Captions

This directory contains implementations and plans for enhancing the caption functionality with advanced typography effects.

## Current Status

- Basic caption functionality is working correctly
- Caption styles (tiktok, modern_bold, etc.) are properly changing text appearance
- Typography effects are defined but need proper implementation

## Implemented Effects

### 1. Fade Effect (`typography_effects_fade.py`)
- Fade in/out effect for each word based on timing
- Customizable fade duration and opacity levels
- Smooth transitions between words

### 2. Scale Effect (`typography_effects_scale.py`)
- Scale words up/down for emphasis based on timing
- Special emphasis for keywords
- Maintains proper word spacing and alignment

### 3. Combined Effects (`typography_effects_combined.py`)
- Demonstration of how to combine multiple effects
- Example of fade + scale working together
- Framework for adding more effect combinations

## Integration Plan

The `integrate_typography_effects.py` file demonstrates how to integrate these effects into the existing captions module. The main steps are:

1. Add effect handler functions to the captions module
2. Update the `make_frame_with_text` function to apply effects
3. Enhance the `TYPOGRAPHY_EFFECTS` dictionary with handler references
4. Add UI controls in the Streamlit app to customize effects

## Effects To Be Implemented

1. **Color Shift Effect**
   - Shift colors based on word importance
   - Create color gradients for different emphasis levels
   - Add smooth color transitions between words

2. **Wave Effect**
   - Make words move in a wave pattern
   - Add sine wave calculation for vertical position
   - Implement time-based wave animation

3. **Typewriter Effect**
   - Make words appear one character at a time
   - Calculate timing for each character appearance
   - Add cursor animation option

## Usage Examples

To test the fade effect:
```python
python typography_effects_fade.py
```

To test the scale effect:
```python
python typography_effects_scale.py
```

To test combined effects:
```python
python typography_effects_combined.py
```

## Next Steps

1. Integrate these effect handlers into the captions module
2. Add UI controls in the Streamlit app to customize effects
3. Create more effects (wave, color_shift, typewriter)
4. Optimize performance for real-time rendering
5. Add documentation and examples for each effect
